# Create a Voice Assistant with OpenAI's GPT-3 and IBM Watson

The guided project takes you through building a virtual assistant that can take voice input, convert it to text using speech-to-text technology, send the text to OpenAI’s GPT-3 model, receive a response, convert it to speech using text-to-speech technology and finally play it back to the user.

## Learning Objectives

- Understand the basics of voice assistants and their various applications
- Set up a development environment for building an assistant using Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, and Javascript
- Implement speech-to-text functionality to allow the assistant to understand voice input from users
- Integrate the assistant with OpenAI’s GPT-3 model to give it a high level of intelligence and the ability to understand and respond to user requests
- Implement text-to-speech functionality to allow the assistant to communicate with users through voice output
- Combine all of the above components to create a functioning assistant that can take voice input and provide a spoken response
- (Optional) Understand how to deploy the assistant to a web server for use by a wider audience
